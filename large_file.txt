The President of India is the constitutional Head of State, a symbol of national unity, and the highest office in the country, serving for a five-year term. While all executive power is vested in the President, these powers are exercised by the Council of Ministers under the leadership of the Prime Minister, to whom the President is bound by advice. The President is indirectly elected by an electoral college of Parliament members and state assembly members. Key powers include the ability to declare war and peace, grant pardons, issue ordinances, and the crucial role of Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Armed Forces.
