'''__init__.py is a special file in Python that is used to indicate that a directory 
 
is a package. It can be an empty file, but it can also contain initialization code for 
 the package. When you import a package, the code in __init__.py is executed, allowing you to set 
 up any necessary variables, functions, 
 or classes that should be available when 
 the package is imported.'''
